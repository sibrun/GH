# Graph Homolgy

Compute the cohomology dimensions of graph complexes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This graph homology library is based on the sage math library. Install the [sage math](http://www.sagemath.org) library and activate the sage shell:
```
$ sage -sh
```
Install the pandas and tqdm modules:
```
(sage-sh)$ pip -install tqdm
(sage-sh)$ pip -install pandas
```
Furthermore, in order to generate graphs up to isomorphism the graph library [nauty](http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) is needed.

Small matrices can be handled using the sage function to compute exact ranks.

In order to determine ranks of large matrices [linbox](https://github.com/linbox-team) and or [rheinfall](https://github.com/riccardomurri/rheinfall)
are required. 
For rank computations the corresponding example code of [linbox](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/blob/master/examples/rank.C) or 
[rheinfall](https://github.com/riccardomurri/rheinfall/blob/master/src.c%2B%2B/examples/rank.cpp) is used.
Replace the rank files by the ones provided in [this](https://github.com/sibrun/GH/tree/master/linbox_rheinfall_rank) folder and compile them.
Finally, move the executables to the folder [GH/rank_exe](https://github.com/sibrun/GH/tree/master/rank_exe).

### Docker
The easiest way to install the prerequisists and use the library is to run it in a Docker container.

Change to the folder [GH/docker](https://github.com/sibrun/GH/tree/master/docker) and build the Docker image from the Dockerfile:
```
$ docker build -t <name docker image> .
```
Alternatively pull an existing docker image with the GH library and all prerequisists from the
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sibrun/ubuntu-gh):
```
$ docker pull sibrun/ubuntu-gh:latest
```
The Docker container will pull the latest version of the Python code of the GH library at startup.

In order to detach the shell later from the process and keep the process running in the background activate a tmux shell:
```
$ tmux
```
Continue inside the tmux shell.
Mount a persistent storage location to the Docker container and run the docker image. 
The generated data will be stored in the persistent storage location:
```
$ docker run -it -v <path to persistent storage location>:/root/GH/gh_data <name docker image:tagname> /bin/bash
```
For developing purposes mount the [GH/source](https://github.com/sibrun/GH/tree/master/source) 
folder of a copy of the GH library to the Docker container such that the Docker container keeps track of changes in the source code:
```
$ docker run -it -v <path to GH library>/GH/source:/root/GH/source <name docker image:tagname> /bin/bash
```
It is possible to mount both the source directory as well as the data directory to the Docker container:
```
$ docker run -it -v <path to GH library>/GH/source:/root/GH/source -v <path to persistent storage location>:/root/GH/gh_data <name docker image:tagname> /bin/bash
```
Run a command from the GH library (as stated below) inside the Docker container:
```
$ sage --python ... 
```
In order to detach the process from the tmux shell first press `ctrl+b` release and after that press `d`.
You can later list all tmux processes with 
```
$ tmux ls
``` 

and attach to the process again with the command
```
tmux attach -t <tmux process number>
```
A tmux process can be quit with the command
```
tmux kill-session -t <tmux process number>
```

## Running the tests

Change to the [GH](https://github.com/sibrun/GH) directory to run the tests:
```
$ sage --python ./source/TestOrdinaryGraphComplex.py
$ sage --python ./source/TestOrdinaryGraphBiComplex.py
$ sage --python ./source/TestHairyGraphComplex.py
$ sage --python ./source/TestHairyGraphBiComplex.py
$ sage --python ./source/TestBiColoredHairyGraphComplex.py
$ sage --python ./source/TestBiColoredHairyGraphBiComplex.py
```

## Running the examples

The file [GraphHomology.py](https://github.com/sibrun/GH/blob/master/source/GraphHomology.py) provides commands to run the implemented
examples. 

Change to the directory GH and build the basis for the ordinary graph complex with odd edges:
```
$ sage --python ./source/GraphHomology.py ordinary -op1 contract -v 3,12 -l 0,9 -odd_e -n_jobs 4 -build_b
```
Afterwards build the operator matrices of the conctract edges and delete edges differentials: 
```
$ sage --python ./source/GraphHomology.py ordinary -op1 contract -v 3,12 -l 0,9 -odd_e -n_jobs 4 -build_op
$ sage --python ./source/GraphHomology.py ordinary -op1 delete -v 3,12 -l 0,9 -odd_e -n_jobs 4 -build_op
```
Then compute the ranks of the operator matrices:
```
$ sage --python ./source/GraphHomology.py ordinary -op1 contract -v 3,12 -l 0,9 -odd_e -n_jobs 4 -sage mod -rank
$ sage --python ./source/GraphHomology.py ordinary -op1 delete -v 3,12 -l 0,9 -odd_e -n_jobs 4 -sage mod -rank
```
Finally test whether the operators square to zero, i.e. build a differential, whether they anti-commute and plot the 
cohomology dimensions of the associated graph complexs for each differential:
```
$ sage --python ./source/GraphHomology.py ordinary -op1 contract -op2 delete -v 0,12 -l 0,9 -odd_e -square_zero -anti_commute -cohomology
```
The cohomology dimensions of the bicomplex with the two differentials contract edges and delete edges can be computed with:
```
$ sage --python ./source/GraphHomology.py ordinary -bicomplex contract_delete -d 0,18 -odd_e -n_jobs 4 -sage mod -build_b -build_op -rank -square_zero -cohomology -csv
```

More examples for hairy graph complexes can be found in the file [GraphHomology.py](https://github.com/sibrun/GH/blob/master/source/GraphHomology.py).

Feel free to extend this library with more examples of graph complexes.

## Documentation
In order to generate a documentation using [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/#) change to the folder 
[GH/docs](https://github.com/sibrun/GH/tree/master/docs) activate the sage shell and generate a html documentation with:
```
(sage-sh)$ make html
```
The html documentation will be found under GH/docs/build/html/index.html.
